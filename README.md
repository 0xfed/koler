## ‚òï Support
We, money, don't have.
We, money, need.
You, money, give.
</br>
You can donate with PayPal.
[![Donate with PayPal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefan-niedermann/paypal-donate-button/master/paypal-donate-button.png)](https://paypal.me/theroeiedri?locale.x=en_US)

Or you can just buy the app from the Play store.
You'll get constant updates without the need to get all the way here and download the release all by yourself and install the release all by yourself and then you realize you have a different package name so you contact me, but I really don't have time for this so I update it on Google Play and then you realize your installer doesn't work and then you realize your whole life is like this, miserable and not working but then you see a point of light in the distance so you run towards and and it's the "Buy" button in the Koler's page on Google Play, and your life is much improved.

## üëç Support Availability
We are aware the app needs more support and updates, due to feature requests and minor bugs.
We are currently not fully available for supporting the app due to a lack of support (seeing as the app is gratis).
We'll do our best to slowly push updates and add the requested features.
If you want to help us and support us so we can put more of our attention towards the app, please consider supporting us (at the bottom of the page).
Feel free to contact us for every little thing.
